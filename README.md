# Zippy
### "Computer info-- fast!"

#### What is Zippy?
Zippy is a simple program I created that gets your computer's information quickly. It uses Node.js' `os` module, which is really cool! Zippy's really simple and easy-to-use-- I'm thinking of perhaps making it better sometime in the future.

#### Can I use Zippy?
Sure! Use its code freely (giving me some credit would be greatly appreciated, though). :)

###### Zippy, 2021 - really simple!
